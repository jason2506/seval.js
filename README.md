# seval.js

## Introduction

The `eval()` function in Javascript is a powerful way to dynamically evaluate the string-represented expressions. But the `eval()` function has some security issues and some environment, such as the [Chrome's extension system](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/contentSecurityPolicy.html), has restricted the use of it.

However, in some particular scenario, we still need to evaluate some expression which contains only arithmetic or logical operation. We don't need the full power of `eval()`, and we don't want to be restricted by the environment.

As a result, I wrote **seval.js**, the simplified `eval()`, for parsing and evaluating the expression contains literal values:

* Number: `123`, `3.1416`, `2e-3`, `0xFF`.
* String: `"hello"`, `'world'`.
* Boolean: `true`, `false`.
* RegExp: `/[a-z]+/i`.
* Other: `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.

variables:

* ASCII: `i`, `foo`, `a3`, `$`, `_under`.
* Non-ASCII: `π`, `中文`, `\u03C0`.

and some common operators:

* Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`.
* Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
* Bitwise operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`.
* Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
* Member operator: `.`, `[`, `]`.
* Call operator: `(`, `)`.
* Special operators: `?:`, `in`, `instanceof`, `typeof`.

The expression parser of the simplified version is generated by [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/) and doesn't involve the `eval()` function, so it won't restricted by the "`eval()` constraint".
